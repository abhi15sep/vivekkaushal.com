COVID-19 has created many problems for the government which are solvable through technological intervention. This here, is a system to manage the daily updation of patient health and current symptoms via call operators for those in home isolation. I worked on this project on a volunteer basis for urgent deployment. The project is built entirely in Flask with Bootstrap 4 for frontend styling.
This system has the following features:

<!-- more -->

- secure admin login
- secure operator login -- for multiple phone operators
- admin features
    - create/delete operator
    - create/delete symptop
    - operator performance visualization
- operator dashboard with daily tasks
- automated patient allocation
- automated backend integration with Google Sheet

Although this system was designed on an urgent basis for COVID relief, the application can also be used for call-center target allocation and other similar usecases.
